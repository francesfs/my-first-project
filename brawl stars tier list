üî• S-Tier Brawlers (Top‚ÄÇTier)
Cordelius: With his teleport and control mechanics, Cordelius is strong in‚ÄÇGem Grab and Showdown.
R-T ‚Äì His range, versatility, and Super can be hell to play against‚ÄÇon control-style maps.
Gray -FLEX/FLANK Gray is a versatile and sneaky agent whose teleporting‚ÄÇSuper and utility tools make him a threat on all modes.
Pearl ‚Äì Great tank and damage dealer‚ÄÇwith team sustainability in team modes.
üí™ A-Tier‚ÄÇBrawlers (Strong & Consistent)
Spike, One of the‚ÄÇtop area control brawlers in the game, remains mostly unchanged.
Leon ‚Äì High burst‚ÄÇvalue and being invisible can seriously damage Solo Showdown.
Max ‚Äì Speedboost‚ÄÇand fast damage are never a problem when in doubt.
Belle's Long Pierce/Long Rangers/Bullet speed reduction from her Super makes her good on‚ÄÇGem Grab and Bounty.
Sam: A very‚ÄÇaggressive pick with good health and area pressure.
‚öñÔ∏èB-Tier:‚ÄÇBrawlers (Good But Situational)
El Primo -Excellent in Brawl Ball but‚ÄÇpoor in long-range fights.
Colette‚ÄÇ‚Äì Mediocre tank counter if not precise.
Surge ‚Äì Must‚ÄÇget heaps of upgrades to be in the limelight, but a destroyer after maxing it out.
Byron: Does well in supporting heavy teams but‚ÄÇneeds escorts.
Bibi: Good‚ÄÇin close-range brawls, and she can use her knockback.

‚ö†Ô∏è C-Tier‚ÄÇBrawlers (Limited Use Only)
Jacky has no range and is poor‚ÄÇagainst meta-brawlers.
Darryl -Rolling can be fine‚ÄÇbut is very situational and can be countered relatively easily.
Poco ‚Äì‚ÄÇWork only with high HP teammates.
Nita ‚Äì Her bear can be helpful, but‚ÄÇshe is outclassed for now.
‚ùå D-Tier Brawlers (Underpowered at‚ÄÇthe moment)
Shelly ‚Äì It's a beginning‚ÄÇbrawler that isn't used in higher trophies.
Bull: Hard against range and‚ÄÇcontrol heavy lineups.
Dynamike ‚Äì too much‚ÄÇdamage to his delay to be consistent.
Frank‚ÄÇ‚Äì Strong but slow to use at a high level.
Final Thoughts
